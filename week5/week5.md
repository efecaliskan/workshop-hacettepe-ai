### **Step 1: Understanding Sentiment Analysis**

- What is sentiment analysis?
- Applications of sentiment analysis (social media, reviews, customer feedback)
- Types of sentiment classification (binary, multi-class, fine-grained)

### **Step 2: Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- Introduction to NLP
- Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)
- Stopword removal (removing common words like "the", "is")
- Lemmatization vs. Stemming

### **Step 3: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

- Handling missing values
- Removing special characters, numbers, and punctuation
- Lowercasing text
- Expanding contractions (e.g., "don't" → "do not")
- Removing URLs, HTML tags, and emojis
- Handling negations in text

### **Step 4: Feature Extraction Techniques**

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Converting text into word frequency vectors
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **n-grams (Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams, etc.)**
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

### **Step 5: Sentiment Analysis Using Traditional Machine Learning**

- **Naïve Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB)**
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees & Random Forest

### **Step 6: Model Evaluation Metrics**

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve

### **Step 7: Deep Learning Approaches for Sentiment Analysis**

- Introduction to deep learning in NLP
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)

### **Step 8: Working with Sentiment Analysis Datasets**

- IMDb movie reviews
- Twitter sentiment datasets
- Sentiment140 dataset
- Kaggle datasets

### **Step 9: Building a Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**

- Loading & preprocessing data
- Vectorizing text data (BoW, TF-IDF, embeddings)
- Training and testing models
- Evaluating results
- Deploying the model (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)
